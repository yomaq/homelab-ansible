Ansible playbooks to manage my non-nixos machines.

Windows playbooks are chaos at the moment, with redundant tasks, tasks not relevant to the current OS, and tasks that I likely don't want to keep at all.
Big work in progress for computers that I mostly don't rely on.
Goal for the windows playbooks is to:
- clean and slim down windows defaults
- set it up as a remote gaming server
- setup nixos on wsl

Plan to manage VyOS through these as well once I switch over to it.
